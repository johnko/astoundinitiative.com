Innovation + creativity.“If we all did the things we are capable of doing, we would literally, astound ourselves.” — Thomas EdisonThe ASTOUND Initiative recognizes that the burgeoning need for private/pubic sector investment in the creative industries is resulting in a number of solutions in the marketplace from the creation of public/private sector investment funds to the development of Ontario-grown crowd-funding technologies. But in keeping with the inventive nature of Thomas Edison, we believe that innovation and creativity are key to developing a more wholistic and integrated solution that a fund alone, or a technology alone cannot answer.Through the ASTOUND Initiative, we are applying novel solutions from other sectors, with a consultative, co-creative approach with the creative industries community and looking at this solution as an iterative design process.ASTOUND is a year-long phased, systematic initiative that seeks to encourage private investment in Ontario’s creative industries. Phase one includes professional intensives and research in business modeling, and audience engagement, and an event framework that introduces private investors with content creators and companies.↑↓Background. A brief history.For the past year, CFC Media Lab either by itself or with partners such as docShift and HotDocs has been running Business Model Design workshops for digital media content businesses and documentary production companies. For the most part, these workshops have been highly successful and resulted in several of the producers changing their development process to include business model design.But more importantly, through these prototypical workshops we have learned that the Business Model Canvas, though easy to understand for most product-based businesses, required some more detailed explaining and even perhaps a “translation” of sorts for content-based businesses. We have also discovered that more case study examples of successful, and diverse sets of business models for content-based businesses are needed to help support uptake of this design process in this industry.As a means of bridging the gap the ASTOUND Initiative was formed towards addressing three key elements in the effort of building new and diverse investment business models for creative content enterprises in Ontario. The workshops will address training. The Salons will address collaboration and knowledge exchange. The Summit intends to incorporate audience voices.The end goal is a systematic approach that encourages private investment in content-based businesses in Ontario.↑↓Lead Partners. Getting things done.The ASTOUND Initiative is led by CFC Media Lab in partnership with Hot Docs, OCADU and is made possible through The Entertainment and Creative Cluster Partnerships Fund administered by the Ontario Media Development Corporation (OMDC) on behalf of the Ministry of Tourism and Culture, and Sport.

Business Modeling Tools and TechniquesCreative Start-ups exemplify the potential for creative industries to spearhead economic and cultural development. As digital media have lowered the entry barriers to produce and distribute content, Creative Start-Ups are embracing the opportunities. The ASTOUND Initiative encourages content creators to think entrepreneurially, explore their unique offerings, revenue potential and understand their business model through the ASTOUND Workshop.Using the Business Model Canvas ASTOUND Workshops will train producers to use the techniques of business model design as set out by Osterwalder and his associates, and evolved by the CFC Media Lab. Specifically targeted to content-based businesses in the digital and interactive media, film and TV, publishing and gaming sub-sectors to provided training and networking opportunities. Through interviews and tracking the business model patterns that emerge we will compile the definitive list of successful business models for Canadian content-based industry and provide new tools and resources with a investment-readiness approach.

Networking and Knowledge ExchangeThe global entertainment and media market was estimated to be worth more than US$1.35 trillion in 2008, and is forecast to grow to approximately US$1.6 trillion by 2013.1 Creative industries now represent a significant proportion of many countries’ GDPs, as economies around the world recognize the importance of the creative industries to their future economic growth. As the “knowledge” versus “industrial” economy continues to grow in importance across all developed and developing countries, creative industries are critical to the larger knowledge economy job creation engine, preparing workers for a digital future that relies on creativity versus physical work.excerpt from Ontario’s Creative Cluster reportFocusing on Creative Start-Ups leads to more nuanced perspectives. Creative Start-Ups are becoming less wedded to the existing business models and better positioned to exploit alternative paradigms. Marrying the culture of investors with that of content creators is essential to the success of the ASTOUND Initiative. The ASTOUND Salons are a series of private and public events focused on bringing investors alongside content entrepreneurs to create a common language and map potential points of engagement between these two cultures. The Salons provide an environment where investors and content creators can collaborate to write a sop and common language around diverse investment business models. Learn more↑↓ASTOUND Summit. The Business of Audience EngagementContent Creators are bypassing record labels and studio deals in favor of alternative business models, relying on online platforms to connect with their fans and funders.The ASTOUND Summit will assess and survey various crowdsourcing, crowdfunding, and audience engagement strategies that have been successful. Although a strong team and a solid track record can go a long way to attract potential investors, for the most part having a handle on what the potential ROI on any given project may be is still critical to closing the deal. We believe that integrating audiences meaningfully throughout the production value chain, and tracking their engagement along the way can be used to mitigate the risk for potential investors.

This workshop takes a participatory approach to create an empowering and interactive working environment that fosters understanding, discussion, creativity, and analysis.The ASTOUND: Business Model Canvas Workshop (BMC workshop) trains content producers to use business model tools and techniques. The business Model Canvas provided a single easy-to-use visual tool allowing users to quickly map their productions and/or businesses, assess viability, realize potential revenue streams, better understand their value proposition, re-imagine their unique business model and investment potential.Through the BMC workshop participants take away a tangible blueprint for their current and future, as well as tools that they can adapt as part of their on-going business practices.Workshop Facilitators. Ana SerannoCFC Media Lab Aaron Williamson Orla GarriquesASTOUND/CFC Media LabBusiness Model Canvas.The success of Alex Osterwalder’s Business Model Generation book and workshops has resulted in the demystification of business model design.The Business Model Canvas is used as a design tool to help businesses get their first principles right starting with who their customer might be. For content-based businesses, especially in Canada where a good proportion of “revenues” are typically derived from government subsidies, knowing for whom you are creating your film, book, ipad app, etc. may be, at best, answered in broad demographic terms (e.g. 18-25 females) or at worst, not answered at all.The Business Model Canvas is a fun, visceral way of encouraging content-based businesses to answer key questions head on. More importantly, it sets out that business modeling is an iterative design process that is at heart “creative.” It underscores how business modeling should be integrated into the content-based industry’s creative process every step of the way.View the 2 minute overview of the Business Model Canvas, a tool for visionaries, game changers, and challengers.Workshop Participants.Sherien BarsoumTaza MediaNina BeveridgeGhosts MediaVladmir BravoLindsay CastelProduction Supervisor for Family Channel and Disney XD CanadaKaren ChapmanCreative ConquerorsSidney ChiuSC ProductionsFuad ChowduryUNL Canada Inc.Craig Allen ConoleyPartus FilmsRebecca DaveyBT ProductionsTamara DawitGobez MediaPaula DevonshireDevonshire ProductionsDaniel EpsteinProcter &amp; Gamble FengliNanjing Broadcasting CorporationNicole Hilliard FordeSide Street ProjectMalinda FrancisHaiti – CMP 2012.pJackie GarrowDocumentary Organization of Canada – Toronto Chapter GelarehHessam GhorbanianParatoo Film / vod onlineHugh GibsonChapeaul FilmsLauren GrantClique PicturesRyan GranthamPost-Production SupervisorRTR MediaRyley GrunenwaldMarie Verite FilmsJoanna GryfeContent AcquisitionShaw MediaMateo GuezTheo FilmsAmy HampsonLifestyle Writer and Website ManagerShaw MediaCher HawryshPhenomenal FilmsAllison HillierAngela JoyceExtreme Entrepreneurs – CMPKelli Kieleykamm/era media groupIndrani KopalHofstra UniversityDawn KuismaBlaze ProductionsMichael LeeCultuvistaMichael LeeMahala MediaTricia LeeA Film Monkey ProductionsStephanie LevyPossibility EntertainmentLawrence LoewingerTwo Points FilmsCarmen Elsa LopezCows in the FieldYan LuHunan TV StationKarnit MandelIndependentJohanna MavhunguMLB Media SolutionsShana McCallaReggae MovementsCat McCormickAntica ProductionsPeter MiddletonFee Fie Foe FilmsLaura MillikenBig Soul ProductionsSarah MoffatSarah Moffat ImageryTshego MoleteHappy Brown Babies ProductionsToni MorganCharles OfficerCaneSugar FilmworksMargarita RamonTerra Incognita ProductionsMonica RichardsonInwood Girl ProductionsKelly-Anne RiessRiess StormmediaHovsep SeraydarianAdam ShamoonDocumentary Organization of Canada – Toronto ChapterCarla SinclairEmpty Cup MediaTina-Louise SmithAccidental Films and TVSosena SolomonA Dopest Ethiopian ProductionsAnastasia TrofimovaAna ValineGideon GirlsSylvie Van BrabantLes Productions du Rapide-BlancShiren Van CootenBebamikawa ProductionsLouise Van HoffOkuhle Media, South AfricaQasim Virjeegetfilmi.comTony VlismaLindsey VodarekManagerCMPA &amp; Independent Doc ProducerVibeke VogelBullitt Film, DenmarkAmar WalaSecret Trial 5 Productions Inc.Douglas WarrenAki WatanabeExpress Sports Co.

DownloadCrowdfunding in a Canadian ContextCrowdfunding is an emerging alternative financing vehicle that has experienced a recent boom in Europe and North America, primarily driven by recent multi-million dollar record-breaking successes on platforms in the US. In the wake of the increased media attention for these campaigns and recent changes to securities laws in the US to accommodate crowdfunding, this financing model has become more visible in Canada as well. A number of Canadian-based crowdfunding platforms have emerged and discussion has been abundant among regulatory and industry bodies—from the tech sector to the creative media sector—regarding how crowdfunding fits into Canada’s current legal, regulatory and funding environment.The Canada Media Fund (CMF) commissioned Nordicity to conduct a study on the topic of crowdfunding in Canada with a mandate to provide both an overview of the global crowdfunding phenomenon as related to the creative content industries and also a domestic environmental scan to determine what the demand for crowdfunding might be among content creators, how they might best leverage this type of funding and how it might fit into the broader structural environment for the creative content industries in Canada.
